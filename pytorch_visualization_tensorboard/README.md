TensorBoard provides the visualization and tooling needed for machine learning experimentation:<br\>
- Tracking and visualizing metrics such as loss and accuracy<br\>
- Visualizing the model graph (ops and layers)<br\>
- Viewing histograms of weights, biases, or other tensors as they change over time<br\>
- Projecting embeddings to a lower dimensional space<br\>
- Displaying images, text, and audio data<br\>
